## Hash Tables Implementation

### What is a hash table?
#### Hashing is an important Data Structure which is designed to use a special function called the Hash function which is used to map a given value with a particular key for faster access of elements.

#### Hashing is the transformation of a string of characters into a usually shorter fixed-length value or key that represents the original string. 

#### For my project I implemented a Hash Table which could do the following:
- Create a hash
- Add items to the hash table
- Prints the number of indexes and the number of items in that location
- Print the Hash Table
- Print all the hash tables that fall under that one index
- Find College (Search for Key)
- Remove Items from Hash Table
In the end my project collected student names, and used their college as a key.
